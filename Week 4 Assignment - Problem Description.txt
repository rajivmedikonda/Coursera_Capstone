Problem:

The problem we are trying to solve in this project is to provide recommendations about to where to establish the 
the new businesses like restaurants, bars, grocery stores etc in the San Francisco Bay Area. Also, we will
provide the recommendations for the real estate business people about where to plan their new commercial or
residential projects. If data and time permits, the last thing we will try to provide as part of solution of this 
project is suggesting the government agencies about where to lay new roads and extend the public transportation services.


Data:

All the data we need as part of this project will be extracted from Foursquare Databases and if needed some external sources 
of data may be involved. We will get all the data about points of interest and venues of different categories from the foursquare
data and apply various techniques to find answers for the above mentioned problems.
